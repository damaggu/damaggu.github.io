I am a Research Scientist at FAIR ([AI at Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/)) working on fundamental computer vision.
Before that I was postdoctoral scholar in the Vision Group at Caltech, working with [Pietro Perona](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j29kMCwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I received my Ph.D. from ETH Zurich, where I worked with [Mehmet Yanik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-KTH7wAAAAJ&hl=en) along with [Valerio Mante](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2hu9WYkAAAAJ), [Angelika Steger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Kzeoyq8AAAAJ), and [Benjamin Grewe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZA-1rh8AAAAJ) on my advisory committee.

I am interested in machine learning and computer vision, particularly in their applications to scientific discovery in biology and medicine. Leveraging large-scale models and self-supervision, I address the challenges of managing and interpreting the rapidly growing volume of (biomedical) data. My work focuses on reducing human effort in data annotation, minimizing bias, revealing hidden patterns in biomedical data, and developing new methods along the way.
